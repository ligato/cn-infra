# CN-infra examples

The examples folder contains several executable examples (built from their 
respective `main.go` files) used to illustrate the cn-infra functionality. 
While most of the examples show a very simple use case, they still need to 
connect to ETCD and/or Kafka. Therefore, you need to have running instances
of Etcd and Kafka to which the examples can connect.

Examples with the suffix `_lib` demonstrate the usage of CN-Infra APIs in 
generic Go programs. You can simply import the CN-Infra library where the
API is declared into your program and starting using the API.

Examples with the suffix `_plugin` demonstrate the usage of CN-Infra APIs
within the context of plugins. Plugins are the basic building blocks of any
given CN-Infra application.  The CNB-Infra plugin framework provides plugin 
initialization and graceful shutdown and supports uniform dependency 
injection mechanism to manage dependencies between plugins.

Current examples:
* **[cassandra lib](cassandra_lib)** shows how to use the Cassandra data 
  broker API
  to access the Cassandra database,
* **[datasync plugin](datasync_plugin)** showcases the data synchronization 
  APIs of the datasync package on an example plugin,
* **[etcdv3 lib](etcdv3_lib)** shows how to use the ETCD data broker API 
  to write data into ETCD and catch this change as an event by the watcher,
* **[flags plugin](flags_plugin/main.go)** registers flags and shows their 
  runtime values in an example plugin,
* **[kafka lib](kafka_lib)** shows how to use the Kafka messaging library
  on set of individual tools (producer, sync and async consumer),
* **[kafka plugin (non-clustered)](kafka_plugin/non_clustered/main.go)** 
  contains a simple plugin which registers a Kafka consumer and sends a test 
  notification,
* **[kafka plugin (clustered)](kafka_plugin/clustered/main.go)** contains 
  a simple plugin which registers a Kafka consumer watching on specific
  partition/offset and sends a test notification to partition in Kafka cluster
* **[logs lib](logs_lib)** shows how to use the logger library and switch 
  between the log levels,
* **[logs plugin](logs_plugin)** showcases how to ue the logger library in a 
  simple plugin,
* **[redis lib](redis_lib)** contains several examples that use the Redis data 
  broker API,
* **[model](model)** show how to define a custom data model using Protocol 
  Buffers and how to integrate it into the application,
* **[simple-agent](simple-agent)** showcases an approach how a set of plugins
  can be turned into an application.

## How to run an example

 **1. Start ETCD server on localhost**

  ```
  sudo docker run -p 2379:2379 --name etcd --rm \
  quay.io/coreos/etcd:v3.0.16 /usr/local/bin/etcd \
  -advertise-client-urls http://0.0.0.0:2379 \
  -listen-client-urls http://0.0.0.0:2379
  ```

 **2. Start Kafka**

 ```
 sudo docker run -p 2181:2181 -p 9092:9092 --name kafka --rm \
  --env ADVERTISED_HOST=172.17.0.1 --env ADVERTISED_PORT=9092 spotify/kafka
 ```

 **3. Start the desired example**

 Each example can be started now from its directory.
 ```
 go run main.go  \
 --etcdv3-config=/opt/vnf-agent/dev/etcd.conf \
 --kafka-config=/opt/vnf-agent/dev/kafka.conf
 ```
