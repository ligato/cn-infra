	// ReadTimeout is the maximum duration for reading the entire
	// request, including the body.
	//
	// Because ReadTimeout does not let Handlers make per-request
	// decisions on each request body's acceptable deadline or
	// upload rate, most users will prefer to use
	// ReadHeaderTimeout. It is valid to use them both.
	ReadTimeout time.Duration

	// ReadHeaderTimeout is the amount of time allowed to read
	// request headers. The connection's read deadline is reset
	// after reading the headers and the Handler can decide what
	// is considered too slow for the body.
	ReadHeaderTimeout time.Duration

	// WriteTimeout is the maximum duration before timing out
	// writes of the response. It is reset whenever a new
	// request's header is read. Like ReadTimeout, it does not
	// let Handlers make decisions on a per-request basis.
	WriteTimeout time.Duration

	// IdleTimeout is the maximum amount of time to wait for the
	// next request when keep-alives are enabled. If IdleTimeout
	// is zero, the value of ReadTimeout is used. If both are
	// zero, there is no timeout.
	IdleTimeout time.Duration

	// MaxHeaderBytes controls the maximum number of bytes the
	// server will read parsing the request header's keys and
	// values, including the request line. It does not limit the
	// size of the request body.
	// If zero, DefaultMaxHeaderBytes is used.
